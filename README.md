# ALBUM SEARCH

## Project Context

- Create a single-page web application that allows you to search iTunes for music and view
albums as the results.

## Should include:

- A search bar to find music in iTunes
- A list of results in a grid format, where each result is an album (the search may return
results matching anything including the artists, album etc., but the entity displayed as
each result should be an album.)
- Each search result should be a card containing artwork, the artist name and the album
name.
- Show only the top 20 results
- A button to be able to switch between the grid format and a vertical list format for the
search results.
- Show more than 20 results, but only up to 20 results per page. Add a paging component
to switch between pages of results.
In the project directory, you can run:

## Tech used:

- React.js (using React Hooks)
- Redux (using Redux Sagas)
- styled components

## Instruction to run the application:

### `npm start`
